    * - Returns a point, in a polar cordinate system (from 0,0), for - Parameter: angle and - Parameter: length
    * - Abstract: a point on a circle where the pivot is TopLeft Corner (0,0)
    * - Parameters:
    *   - radius: the radius of the circle
    *   - angle: the angle where the point is (in radians) (-π to π) (3.14.. to 3.14..)
    * - Note: formula "<angle*cos*radius,angle*sin*radius>"

    * - Note: Base formula CosΘ = x/len
